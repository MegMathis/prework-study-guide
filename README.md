# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Study Guide was used to help students with process of going through the prework.  It was used to keep a handy set of notes during class.  I built this project to have a better understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GIT.  The Study Guide allows for a one stop shop of notes instead of multiple pages of notes.  I learned how important it is to have an understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GIT.
